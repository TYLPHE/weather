## Features
- Fetches and displays API information from OpenWeather
- Convert data to Fahrenheit or Celsius

## About
> Use everything weâ€™ve been discussing to create a weather forecast site using the weather API from the previous lesson. You should be able to search for a specific location and toggle displaying the data in Fahrenheit or Celsius.

> You should change the look of the page based on the data, maybe by changing the color of the background or by adding images that describe the weather. (You could even use the Giphy API to find appropriate weather-related gifs and display them). Feel free to use promises or async/await in your code, though you should try to become comfortable with both.

The weather assignment focuses on the fetch, async, and await functions to pull API data from OpenWeather. I wanted to make my app a widget to practice more phone-like features like a drop-down menu. In this case, the search menu slides from  Weather is my first API project.
